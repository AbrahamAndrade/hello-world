# hello-world
honoring the time honored tradition.
Hey! I'm a new up-in-coming coder who has no idea what lies at the end of this rabbit hole but I'm optimistic. I like having fun and interesting conversations with people how have undesignated sense of reality. I enjoy videogames, music, laughing hard, getting paid, women, books, scented candles, going to the movies, watching movies at home, cooking, driving, and lets not forget about code. I'm 23 as of this comment, and I'm a computer science major attending college.
